## Usage

### Basic Proofreading
1. Use the command `Proofread selection/paragraph` to check the selected
   text. If there is no selection, the command will check the current paragraph.
	* Alternatively, you can also check the whole document with `Proofread full
	  document`. However, note that the quality of AI suggestions tends to
	  decrease when proofreading too much text at once.
2. The changes are automatically inserted.
3. Accept/reject changes with `Accept suggestions in selection/paragraph`
   and `Reject suggestions in selection/paragraph`.  
   Same as the proofreading command, the `accept` and `reject` commands affect
   the current paragraph if there is no selection. Alternatively, you can also
   only accept/reject the next suggestion after your cursor via `Accept next
   suggestion` and `Reject next suggestion`.

### Smart Proofreading Modes
1. Go to `Settings â†’ Proofreader`
2. Select your preferred **Proofreading Mode**:
   - **Quick Fix**: For fast, obvious corrections
   - **Balanced**: Standard proofreading (default)
   - **Style Improvement**: Enhanced writing style
   - **Academic**: Formal, academic tone
   - **Creative**: Preserve creative voice
3. Choose **Severity Level**:
   - **Minor**: Minimal changes
   - **Moderate**: Standard corrections (default)
   - **Major**: Comprehensive improvements

### Apply Functions
For immediate corrections without review:
1. Use `Apply proofreading to selection/paragraph` for direct text replacement
2. Use `Apply proofreading to full document` for immediate document-wide corrections
3. Text is replaced instantly without showing suggestions

## Visual appearance of the changes
The plugin now includes enhanced CSS styling by default. The visual improvements include:
- Smooth animations for new suggestions
- Improved contrast and readability
- Hover effects with tooltips
- Theme-specific optimizations
- Professional rounded corners and shadows

For additional customization, you can still add CSS snippets:
([Manual: How to add CSS snippets.](https://help.obsidian.md/snippets))

```css
.cm-strikethrough {
	text-decoration-color: var(--color-red);
}

.cm-s-obsidian span.cm-highlight {
	background-color: rgba(var(--color-green-rgb), 35%);
}
```

## Testimonials

> I was paying $29 a month for type.ai until today, your plugin made me cancel
> the subscription, because the only feature I wanted from there was this inline
> granular diffing which no other app offered, until Proofreader.
